# Research Photo Management with Tropy 
Adapted from NCSU Libraries Digital Scholarship Workshop Series Available at: [https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/digital-scholarship-workshops](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/digital-scholarship-workshops)

## Setup: Download & Load Photos 

- Download this repository as a zip file by clicking [this link](https://github.com/BrockDSL/Tropy-Tutorial/archive/master.zip)
- Unzip the file.
- Download Tropy at [https://tropy.org](https://tropy.org)
- Open Tropyfrom your Applications folder (Mac) or Programs folder (Windows). When you first start Tropy, you should see a window requesting you to Create a new project. In the future if you would like to create a new project, click File>New>Project.
- Add the nameof the collection you are working with for your research. For example, we will be working with the Seburn Family Collection, so enter “Seburn Family Research”

- Now you are ready to add photos to your project. Navigate to File> Importphotos. You can select one photo from your files, or Ctrl/Command+A, you can select multiple photos. Select all photos in theSeburn Family folder, then click open in the dialogue box.

## Grid & List View

- You can view your items in a list or in a photo grid. To switch between these views, use the slider at the top of the item table. Your photos appear as a list when the slider is all the way to the left.

## Editing Photos
Tropy allows you to do basic photo editing. You can do all your photo editing using the toolbar at the top of the photo pane in Item view.

From left to right, the buttons are as follows:
1. Arrow: This is the basic tool for clicking on your photo. Double-clicking on your photo while the arrow is active will zoom your photo 100%.  
2. Select: This tool allows you to make selections that stand on their own.   
3. Rotate: This button rotates your photo counterclockwise by 90 degrees. The keyboard shortcut for this action is Ctrl+space.  
4. Mirror: This button flips your photo to its mirror.  
5. Pan: Pan allows you to move your photo around while it is zoomed in. You can also activate pan by holding down the space bar.  
6. Fit width: This button will fit your photo to the width of the window.  
7. Fill: This button will fill your whole photo into the window.  
8. Zoom slider: You can also manually zoom in or out on your photo.

You can also adjust various settings on your photos to make them more legible. To access the advanced photo editing tools, click on the button on the far right of the photo editing panel.

> ### Activity 1
> Many of the images need to be rotated (eg. IMG_20200228_141218.jpg). Go through and rotate as many as you can in 2 minutes. 
  
## Adding Metadata

In Tropy, you can add Metadata for each item. Metadata can be as freeform as you want. But it’s generally best to try to record metadata using a standard that already exists. Why? Metadata standards provide consistency both within your own projects and also in the larger community of scholarship about your sources. Each category in a Tropy metadata template must be linked to a category (property) from an existing metadata standard. Tropy uses the Dublin Core metadata schema. If you would like to learn more about Dublin Core, visit [http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/)

At present you can only use each property once in a template. Several standards, or vocabularies, are included in Tropy. Tropy defaults to the “Tropy Generic” Metadata template, but you can select other metadata templates, such as the Tropy Correspondence template. The “Tropy Generic” Metadata template includes the following fields:

- Title: Name of the source or essential description of the item  
- Creator: Author of the source  
- Date: Date the source was created. In order to effectively organize and find sources based on date, use a consistent date format like YYYY-MM-DD (known as ISO format). If the date is uncertain, use ~ before the date (e.g., ~1802, or ~1802-01-01)  
- Type: Type or genre of source. For example, Correspondence.  
- Archive: is the location at which the source can be found, (e.g., the Library of Congress or Brock Archives and Special Collections).
- Collection: is the name of the collection of which the source is a part, (e.g. Seburn Family fonds). You should consult a catalog or finding aid to ensure that you use the correct title for a collection.  
- Box: is the unit in the collection which the source can be found. This category may not be needed for all sources, as not all collections have boxes, so you may leave this field blank if not needed.  
- Folder: is the folder (within a box) in which a source can found. This category may not be needed for all sources, as not all collections use folders as a form of organization, or label or number folders, so you may leave this field blank if not needed.  
- Identifier: is a call number or URL at which a source can be found. This field could also be used to include a link to an online finding aid for a collection.  
- Rights: is information about how you, a researcher, can use each item. This can include copyright information, as well as specific information from the archive where the image came from. Where possible, best practice is to include a link/URL to the information on rights provided by the archive or library where the source is located.

> ### Activity 2
> Press Shift and select the first 8 images. Add the following bulk metadata:
>
> Title:
>
> Creator:
>
> Date:
>
> Type:
>
> Archive: Brock Archives & Special Collections
>
> Collection: Seburn Family Fonds
>
> Box: 1
>
> Folder: 1
>
> Identifier: RG 627
>
> Rights: Current copyright applies
